# Posist
posist round 2 code(see redme)
It's a kind of block chain program which is quite hard.
All the structure that has been made as follows:-
1.)Timestamp
2.)Data
3.)nodeNumber
4.)nodeId
5.)referenceNodeId
6.)childReferenceNodeId
7.)genesisReferenceNodeId
8.)HashValue

The Fuctions that are enclosed with the given file are:-
1.)Create The Genesis Node. Genesis Node Has Parent node as NULL.
2.)Create a Set Of Child Nodes of a particular node.
3.)Encrypt and Decrypt data inside the node.
4.)OwnerID Set for all nodes and verified.
5.)Encryption and Decryption of Data.


The compilation steps are:-
1.)Install python3(Common For Both)
2.)Run the python3 IDLE 
3.)Open the project folder and select the file 
4.)Then run on python shell 

OR

1.)Open CMD
2.)Then GO To the file location 
3.)Then write python3 filename.py

PS:- This Was an implementation of a BlockChain Program and required more time for computation.
